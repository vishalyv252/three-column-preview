# three-column-preview

Hello guys, In this project, I created a "Three Column Preview" using "React JS" and "Tailwind". In Tailwind, I applied flex as the layout for styling the component and I applied overflow for scrolling the screen in mobile view. Whereas React allows you to write the HTML code within a javascript file using "JSX". If you want to see the web page, just click the link below the description of this repository.
